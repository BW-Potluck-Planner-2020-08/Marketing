                <h3>Will never use another app</h3>
                <p>As an avid thrower of potlucks, I loved using Potluck Planner! No other app helps clearly connect host and guest. I know exactly who is coming and who is bringing what. More potlucks to come thanks to Potluck Planner!</p>

                <h3>I'm an Potluck Planner addict</h3>
                <p>Ever since using Potluck Planner I've never been able to go back. In the same way people are addictied to Facebok, Instagram, or LinkedIn, I am addictied to Potluck Planner. These people are geniuses!</p>

                <h2>Dave, 24, Single Bachelor</h2>
                <h3>Great for every ocasion</h3>
                <p>To be honest, I thought Potluck Planner was just an app that my mom would use. After trying it out, I realized Potluck Planner is great for every ocasion. Sometimes I want a small group of guys to come over for the football game on sunday. Other times, when I want to throw a bigger party at my house I can, It is so easy to invite people to my various events and there is no stress in wondering if the food will make it on time! Can't wait to see what is next for me and my Potluck Planner</p>

                <h3>Potluck Peace</h3>
                <p>I'll never forget the amount of work I'd have to go through in order to organize, contact, and confirm who was coming and bringing what to my events. With Potluck Planner, I can do all of it in the same app! I'll never have to worry whether or not Becky and Amy are going to go at it after bringing the same dish LOL!</p>
